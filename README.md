## Abstract

Actual stateful Azure deployments, level up your Bicep game with Deployment Stacks

Bicep is great for deploying resources to Azure, but regular deployments do have some limitations. Using the new deployment type called Deployment Stacks, Azure can keep track of all resources deployed and for example delete them if they are removed from you template. Stacks also comes with the superpower called deny assignments, giving you the power to deny access to specific actions on your resources. And the best of all, you don't need to change anything in your code!

Learn all about Deployment Stacks and bring your Bicep questions!
